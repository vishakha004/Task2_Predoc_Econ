# Task 2 Assignment 
This repository contains my attempt to solve the coding assignment from the Econ RA guide (https://raguide.github.io/new_email).

## Folder Description and Sources

### Raw data:
The raw data has been sourced from the link given above. 
hospital.csv is a dataset of hospitals in each city and respective number of asthma cases.
city.csv is a dataset containing population estimates, production quantity of pokeballs and pokeball factories from 2000 to 2015.

## Code
All code here is written and run in Stata BE (Basic Edition). It is recommended to use the Do-file Editor in Stata for executing the scripts.

## How to Run

**Step 1:**
Access the Assignment file and the data_for_analysis folder. Make sure to store all data sets as named in the repository.

**Step 2:**
Set the folder the data is stored in as Working Directory. Note that all Stata scripts must be created in the same Working Directory.

**Step 3:**
Download the code.do file, and open it in Stata. Set the Working Directory as on your machine, and run the script to get cleaned and merged data sets, graphs and DiD estimates.

**Step 4:**
The Solutions PDF contains the required answers and data analysis summary.
